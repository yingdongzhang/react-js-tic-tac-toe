## ReactJS Tutorial Completed

ReactJS tutorial completed with improvements:

* Bold the currently-selected item in the move list.

* Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.

* Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.

* When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.

Also added

* You can start over.

* It shows "Tie" when it is a tie.

Not completed:

* Display the move locations in the format "(1, 3)" instead of "6". Don't quite understand the requirement :D.
